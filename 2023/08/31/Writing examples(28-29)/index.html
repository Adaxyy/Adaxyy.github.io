<h1 id="Ref-writing"><a href="#Ref-writing" class="headerlink" title="Ref writing"></a>Ref writing</h1><h2 id="1"><a href="#1" class="headerlink" title="1"></a>1</h2><p>Global warming would have profound impact on the survival and prosperity of human species, and it is necessary for governments to take action. I think government should provide financial support for citizens to buy more environmental friendly vehicles or electronic cars because it would be more effective than expanding public transport. Providing financial support can increase the need of purchasing electronic cars, while expanding public transport will not make more people to choose to use it. The city that I live in provides financial support for buying electronic cars, which make the prices fall. When my mother was choosing a car to buy for herself this year, she chooses electronic cars other than the petrol-powered cars because electronic vehicles is cheaper and the inner design of the car presents a more advanced technology. The electronic cars being made these days often includes user-friendly technology, and I believe the financial aid from governments would increase the need of buying these cars which would be more environmental friendly.</p>
<h2 id="2"><a href="#2" class="headerlink" title="2"></a>2</h2><p>As technology develops, children gradually have more access to different ways of learning including educational games on screen. I think if the time is controlled well by their guardians, educational games can be beneficial for small children. Children are often bored when learning how to read and do math, and educational games can make the learning process more appealing for children. They will have a greater interest and enjoy the learning process, and children can have access to learning resources that are not available in their surroundings. My brother is 4 years old, and my parents sometimes let him to play educational games for 20 minutes at a time. He uses the game to learn English words. My brother enjoys learning English as he watches the letters dance and sing, and he also get a chance to match words with pictures. More importantly, neither of my parents speaks English. The game helps him to happily learn about something that cannot be directly provided by his environment.</p>
<h2 id="3"><a href="#3" class="headerlink" title="3"></a>3</h2><p>Ongoing employee training is the most important investment a company can make. No matter whether workers are highly skilled and full of experience or not, there are still some drawbacks. Those drawbacks could be fulfilled and fixed by company training, therefore improving their working efficiencies. In the overall picture, the whole company’s performance could have a strong elevation. Furthermore, ongoing employee training not only enhances personal ability but also builds relationships with co-workers. When attending training, collaborative group work is an essential part of the session. Thus, in those group collaborations, workers would have the chance to both strengthen their relationships and connect with unfamiliar coworkers. The positive relationship makes workers feel the company is not only a place to work but also a comfort zone where they can search for support. Therefore, having a positive relationship with co-workers also serves an important role in promoting the company’s performance.</p>
<h2 id="4"><a href="#4" class="headerlink" title="4"></a>4</h2><p>It is not a good idea for young children to play educational computer games. Even though educational computer games have the title ‘educational’, the essence of them is still a game, a trap that draws young children to addiction. Young children lack self-determination and self-control. In the meantime, the game interested them so much because it is an innovative and interactive commodity. Gradually, the purpose of educational games has no longer been developing children’s intelligence but purely letting them get addicted to games. Therefore, early exposure to gaming causes them to grow up with a great interest in video games rather than a strong desire to explore learning. Furthermore, video games are frequently used to teach children using fictional characters. However, this would cause young children to blend reality and fiction, causing them to be confused about the seriousness of knowledge. Finally, as fictional characters are employed, young children would not take them seriously about knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="5"><a href="#5" class="headerlink" title="5"></a>5</h2><p>America has seen some spectacular investment booms: think of the railways in the 1860s, Detroit’s car industry in the 1940s or the fracking frenzy in this century. Today the latest bonanza is in full swing, but instead of steel and sand it involves scripts, sounds, screens and celebrities. This week Disney launched a streaming service which offers “Star Wars” and other hits from its vast catalogue for $6.99 a month, less than the cost of a dvd. As the business model pioneered by Netflix is copied by dozens of rivals, over 700m subscribers are now streaming video across the planet. Roughly as much cash—over $100bn this year—is being invested in content as it is in America’s oil industry. In total the entertainment business has spent at least $650bn on acquisitions and programming in the past five years.</p>
<h2 id="6"><a href="#6" class="headerlink" title="6"></a>6</h2><p>After the pandemic, travelling became even more popular, especially towards rural areas where they could be exposed to the natural environment. However, tourism could be a great threat to the local environment and disrupt the daily life of residents. Rather than promoting tourism by improving infrastructure, giving discounts on tickets, and advertising, the government should instead protect some areas from tourists. Tourists may leave garbage along their path and increase the risk of catching a forest fire during a picnic, which will greatly damage the local environment. Moreover, tourists would occupy public resources, which may hurt local residents. For example, I often go cycling along the HuangPu River after dinner. But after removing lock-down policies and other restrictions for the pandemic, the amount of tourist to Shanghai has increased significantly. When the walking path is relatively crowded, tourist would walk on the cycling path and hence affect riders- we have to slow down to avoid any accidents.  </p>
<h2 id="7"><a href="#7" class="headerlink" title="7"></a>7</h2><p>The government should subsidize electric car production and consumption since it would be a more effective way to reduce carbon emissions. Promoting electric cars could reduce carbon emissions because unlike traditional petrol-powered cars, electric cars would not release greenhouse gases, which will contribute to global climate change. In addition, research conducted in California shows that a 1000$ subsidy on electric car consumption could increase the demand for electric cars by 30%. The result indicates that the demand for electric vehicles is elastic, and a subsidy could greatly impact the demand. Moreover, subsidizing electric cars industry could be more beneficial than investing in public transportation in terms of economic development. The technology of building public transportation infrastructure is relatively matured, while there is still lots of efforts needed to improve the design and manufacturing of electric cars. A financial support to electric-car producers would boost the growth of this industry and attract more talents. Especially for developing countries, this would help the nations shift from low-end manufacturing to high-end industries.</p>
